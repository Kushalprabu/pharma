## Key Features in Detail

### 1. AI Demand Forecasting Algorithm

**Input**: 90 days of historical consumption data

**Process**:
1. Calculate Simple Moving Average (7-day window)
2. Detect seasonality factor (weekly patterns)
3. Analyze trend (increasing/decreasing demand)
4. Apply day-of-week adjustment (1.1x for weekdays, 0.8x for weekends)
5. Calculate prediction confidence score

**Output**: 7-day demand forecast with 30-90% confidence

**Example**:
- Historical: Paracetamol averages 50 units/day
- Weekday factor: 1.1 (higher weekday demand)
- Prediction for Monday: ~55 units
- Confidence: 85%

### 2. AI Insights Generation

**Restocking Alerts**:
- Triggered when stock < minimum_level
- Recommends: reorder_quantity or forecast-based amount
- Priority: HIGH if critical low, MEDIUM otherwise

**Expiry Risk Alerts**:
- 90 days before expiry: Info
- 60 days before: Warning
- 30 days before: Critical
- After expiry: Critical (expired)
- Recommends: Usage prioritization or redistribution

**Cost Optimization**:
- Identifies slow-moving items
- Suggests batch consolidation
- Estimates savings

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

|------|------------|
| **Admin** | Full access, user management, all reports |
| **Pharmacist** | Inventory ops, order tracking, local alerts |
| **Hospital** | View inventory, place orders, track shipments |
| **Auditor** | Read-only access to all data, audit logs |
